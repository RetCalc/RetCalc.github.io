# RetCalc redesign notes

Issues found during the redesign that are logged here rather than fixed in
the pass that found them. Each says where it is and what fixing it involves.

## Open

### System theme doesn't follow the OS while a page is open

Found 2026-10-06, during the redesign's setup pass.

With the theme set to System (the default, and "System" on the About page's
switch), the theme is worked out once, when the page loads: the inline
script in `<head>` (`web/lib/theme-script.ts`) reads
`prefers-color-scheme` and sets `data-theme` on `<html>`. Nothing listens
for that preference changing afterwards, so if the OS switches between
light and dark (by hand, or on a schedule at sunset) an open RetCalc page
keeps the old theme until it is reloaded or another page is opened.

- Where: `web/lib/theme.ts` (`resolveTheme`, `applyTheme`, `setThemeChoice`)
  and `web/lib/theme-script.ts`. No `matchMedia(...).addEventListener("change", ...)`
  anywhere in `web/`.
- Not a regression: the old site (`src/js/app/19-widgets-theme.js`) behaved
  the same way, and the migration carried it over unchanged.
- Fixing it: while the stored choice is "system", listen for
  `matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: light)")` changes and call
  `applyTheme(resolveTheme("system"))`; stop when the visitor picks Light
  or Dark. One small client-side listener, e.g. in a component mounted once
  in the layout. It changes the toggle's behavior, so it's left for a
  separate, deliberate change: the brief says to keep the toggle and its
  behavior as they are.
